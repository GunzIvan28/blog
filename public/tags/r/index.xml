      <description>I have been delaying it for a while, but I finally decided to move to blogdown. This post is designed to quickly capture my reasons for me changing, and highlight some of the features that may make you consider doing the same.

      <description>knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE)For my PhD research, I needed to collect local political data for the UK. This article documents the data sources and procedure used to create a suitable dataset for my analysis. This provides a technical overview of the data. The R code used to create the analysis is available through GitHub here.
SetupR was used to run the analysis. The code uses a number of packages to process the data:</description>

      <description>RMarkdown is a powerful tool for producing documents with embedded R code, allowing you to easily reproduce analysis and greatly simplify your data-driven workflow. It can be used to generate dynamic reports, presentations, journal papers, and even your thesis!
The presentation was designed to provide a whistle-stop tour of the benefits of RMarkdown, explaining the basic syntax to get started and highlighting some of the more advance things which you could use RMarkdown for.</description>

      <description>IntroAlthough R is widely used for data processing and statistical modelling, it is less frequently known for its powers of handing Geospatial Data. This presentation is aimed to highlgiht why people may want to consider using R for their GIS, and highlight some of the benefits of using R in their analyses.
Why use R for GISThere are many benefits of using R for GIS, but to me the top three reasons would be:</description>
