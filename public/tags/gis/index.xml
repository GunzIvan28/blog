      <description>A while back on StackOverflow, I answered a question on how: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45682226/r-counting-how-many-polygons-between-two/47007246#47007246
Code knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE) # Load packages library(raster) # loads shapefile library(igraph) # build network library(spdep) # builds network library(RColorBrewer) # for plot colour palette library(ggplot2) # plots results # Load Data powiaty &amp;lt;- shapefile(&amp;quot;C:/Users/Mikey/Downloads/powiaty/powiaty&amp;quot;) Firstly the poly2nb function is used to calculate neighbouring regions:
# Find neighbouring areas nb_q &amp;lt;- poly2nb(powiaty) This creates our spatial mesh, which we can see here:</description>

      <description>Intro Although R is widely used for data processing and statistical modelling, it is less frequently known for its powers of handing Geospatial Data. This presentation is aimed to highlgiht why people may want to consider using R for their GIS, and highlight some of the benefits of using R in their analyses.
 Why use R for GIS There are many benefits of using R for GIS, but to me the top three reasons would be:</description>

What is the problem? Wind energy provides a key opportunity for the UK government to meet decarbonisation targets. There is wide avaialbility of resource across the country, and onshore wind provides one of the most mature and cost-effective methods to supply renewable electricity.</description>

      <description>Back in May 2016, a friend and I undertook one of the challenges which we had wanted to do for years and cycled the length of the United Kingdom from Land’s End to John O’ Groats. It was a fantastic experience and something I would love to do again one day. This blog provides a summary of our trip and aims to aid anyone who may be planning their own trip.</description>
