Writing your thesis in R Markdown: my experience

After a challenging three and a half years of work, I finally graduated as Doctor of Philosophy in July 2018. As for any PhD, a massive part of this work was the completion of a thesis.

# How I got there

As like many people, my primary experience in word processing was through Microsoft Word. For short reports, this has always worked fantastically for me, yet I faced two particular issues with creating longer reports. The need for a better solution only came 18 months into my studies, and I finally migrated my work to LaTeX.

Whilst LaTeX provided much improvement over Word, it created other problems whilst not solving some of my primary issues. Primarily, my supervisors were uncomfortable editing raw LaTeX files, and equally unhappy if I sent them a compiled PDF of the report which made it difficult for them to manually edit.

For me I chose to heavily integrate these two, and much of the data processing, statistical analysis etc. was directly contained within the report. Whilst this was fantastic for reproducibility, it created several difficulties along the line.

It is also easy to forget how much oneself improves with coding over three years of study. By embedding a lot of
