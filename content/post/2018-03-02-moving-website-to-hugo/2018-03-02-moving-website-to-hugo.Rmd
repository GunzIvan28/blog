```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, out.width = "100%")
library(widgetframe)
```

I have been toying with the idea for a while about setting up a website through Hugo. ^[This is a  footnoted]

The aim of this article is not to provide a technical guide of the setup process, but instead explain the benefits and why a user may want to consider using it. 

> Note: this post contains all the example code so that maps can easily be replicated in R. If you would like to access the full sourcecode, you can download it through GitHub [here](https://github.com/mikey-harper/blog/tree/master/content/post/2018-03-02-moving-website-to-hugo).

# Reasons To Consider


## 1. Easily (and cheaply) host your website

Blogdown is a static site generator. This means that any processing to build the webpage is done on your computer, and then the website host

The major benefit to this is that websites are lightening fast, and that you do not have to fork out for server hire. This 

As there is no server-side processing, websites are much more scalable. 

### Wordclouds

```{r, out.width="100%"}
library(DT)
frameWidget(DT::datatable(iris, options = list(pageLength = 5)))
```




# Why Consider


One of the best things about Hugo is that the

The guidance for [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is really useful.



## Features

One of the things I often want to do with my blog is share code and analysis. With blogdown, it is really easy for R data analysis to be directly integrated into a web page. This directly integrates [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) into posts.

**Citations**

With academic writing, it is a requirement to ensure that analysis is well reference

With [@fenner2012a]

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c("rmarkdown", "knitr", "leaflet", "ggplot2", "plotly", "DiagrammeR"), file = "test.bib")
```

[@R-knitr]

## Interactive Charts

Visualizations are often static, with the purpose of presentation rather than the exploration of data [@Malik2011]. To many people, a graph will be made in Excel, saved as an image and then inserted into a report. By not allowing the user to interact with the data, it limits interaction and exploration with the results.

Most users of R will be familiar of the package `ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2], which is frequently used as the main plotting system in R. The `plotly` [@R-plotly] package builds upon the ggplot2 and provides a tool to easily convert graphs into an interactive, web-based version.

Figure \@ref(fig:Shiny) shows a basic interactive Shiny plot. The user can hover over bars to find out more details about the group, and also use the legend to turn on and off layers. 

```{r Shiny, fig.cap="Interactive Shiny Plot"}
# Code to build basic ploty graph
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
            geom_bar(position = "dodge")
ggplotly(p)
```

Plotly is recommended as many R users will be familiar with ggplot. However, there are lots of other options available for plotting graphs and graphics, and many build off existing Javascript libraries. These include:

- [dygraphs for R](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/): an R interface to the dygraphs JavaScript charting library.
- [scatterD3](https://github.com/juba/scatterD3): R scatter plot htmlwidget based on D3.js
- [rbokeh](https://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/): provides an R Interface for Bokeh

There are many more examples provided in the [htmlwidgets gallery](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/).

## Interactive Maps

Static maps can be quite challenging to make effectively. It is difficult to know which scale at which they should be drawn. If you produce a national map, most users will want to zoom into their area and find out more results about their local area.

Maps can easily be made using the **leaflet** [@R-leaflet] package. Using the following example taken from [here](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), we can create maps in only a few lines of code:

```{r leaflet, fig.cap= "A leaflet map, with an example point", out.width='100%', fig.asp=0.5}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-1.39595, lat=50.93463, popup="Southampton University")
m
```

## Flowcharts and Visualisations

It can often be useful to visualise flowcharts or networks in R. I particularly like to use them when explaining my data analysis process. Figure \@ref(fig:DiagrammeR) highlights a basic structure for a flowchart, using the package `DiagrammeR` [@R-DiagrammeR] t build a GraphViz plot:

```{r DiagrammeR, fig.cap="An example Flowchart from DiagrammeR", fig.asp=0.25}

library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("digraph a_nice_graph {

        graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
        
        # node definitions with substituted label text
        node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = WhiteSmoke]        
        rec1 [label = '@@1']
        rec2 [label = '@@2']
        rec3 [label = '@@5']
        rec4 [label = '@@6']

        node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = oval]
        ova1 [label = '@@3']
        ova2 [label = '@@4']

        # edge definitions with the node IDs
        rec1 -> ova1 -> rec2 -> ova2 -> rec3
        ova2 -> rec4
        }
      
        [1]: 'raw data'
        [2]: 'cleaned data'
        [3]: 'clean and tidy'
        [4]: 'describe'
        [5]: 'report'
        [5]: 'website'
      ")
```
