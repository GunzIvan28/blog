A while back on StackOverflow, I [answered a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45682226/r-counting-how-many-polygons-between-two/47007246#47007246) on how to produce a map which showed how many polygons away a location was from another, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mapResult). This blog provides an update on how this can be used, with some slight tweaks to the answer to expand on the original. A lot of this content is based around the original from [Roger Bivand](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/vignettes/nb_igraph.html) here.

```{r mapResult, fig.cap="The final output!"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kBT6.png")
```

# Setup

In order to calculate neighbouring polygons, we need to form a network of nodes for the data. This is done using the **igraph** [@R-igraph] **spdep** [@R-spdep] and **spatialreg** [@R-spatialreg] packages. We also use the **raster** [@R-raster] package to download some example data, and **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2] for the final visualisation.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(raster) # loads shapefile
library(igraph) # build network
library(spdep) # builds network
library(spatialreg)
library(RColorBrewer)  # for plot colour palette
library(ggplot2) # plots results
library(tmap)
```

First downloading the data as follows. The input data is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:loadData). You could easily provide your own shapefile here instead or run the code for a different country by changing the three-digit code. For my example, I have selected Hungary:

```{r loadData, fig.cap = "Loaded data for the raster package"}
# Load Data
boundaries <- raster::getData(name = "GADM", country = "HUN", level = 2)

# Show data
tm_shape(boundaries) +
  tm_polygons()
```

## Extracting neigbours

Firstly the `poly2nb` function is used to calculate neighbouring regions, based on contiguous boundaries, that is sharing one or more boundary point. The resulting mesh and coordinates is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:produceMesh)

```{r produceMesh, fig.cap = "Mesh outputs from poly2nb"}
# Find neighbouring areas
nb_q <- poly2nb(boundaries)

# Plot original results
coords <- coordinates(boundaries)

# Show the results
plot(boundaries)
plot(nb_q, coords, col="grey", add = TRUE)
```

With this mesh, we can then calculate the shortest path between two locations. The follow function returns a list for each and every pair of polygons.

```{r}
# Sparse matrix
nb_B <- nb2listw(nb_q, style="B", zero.policy=TRUE)
B <- as(nb_B, "symmetricMatrix")
    
# Calculate shortest distance
g1 <- graph.adjacency(B, mode="undirected")
sp_mat <- shortest.paths(g1)
```

Having made the calculations, the data can now be formatted to get into plotting format, so the shortest path matrix is merged with the spatial dataframe.

```{r}
# Name used to identify data
referenceCol <- boundaries$GID_2
  
# Rename spatial matrix
sp_mat2 <- as.data.frame(sp_mat)
sp_mat2$id <- rownames(boundaries@data)
names(sp_mat2) <- paste0(referenceCol)
          
# Add distance to shapefile data
boundaries@data <- cbind(boundaries@data, sp_mat2)
boundaries@data$id <- rownames(boundaries@data)
```

The data is now in a suitable format to display. Using the basic function `spplot` we can get a graph quite quickly:

```{r}
tm_shape(boundaries) +
  tm_polygons("HUN.15.5_1", n = 15) 
```

# Plotting in ggplot2

I prefer ggplot for plotting more complex graphs as you can control the styling easier. Fortunately, **ggplot2** now directly supports spatial data through `geom_sf` format. I have customised it a bit by removing elements which aren't required and added a background. The final map is shown below in Figure \@ref(fig:finalMap).

```{r finalMap, fig.cap="Final Neighbouring Region Map"}

# Convert data to sf format
boundaries_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(boundaries)

ggplot(boundaries_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = HUN.15.5_1)) +
  geom_sf(fill = "grey", alpha = ifelse(boundaries_sf$GID_2 == "HUN.15.5_1", 1, 0)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#d73027", mid = "#fee08b", high = "#1a9850", midpoint = 10) +
  theme(
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA), 
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA), 
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA),
    panel.border = element_blank())
```
