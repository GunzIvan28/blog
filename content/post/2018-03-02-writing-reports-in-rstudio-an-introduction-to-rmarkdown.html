<p>RMarkdown is a powerful tool for producing documents with embedded R code, allowing you to easily reproduce analysis and greatly simplify your data-driven workflow. It can be used to generate dynamic reports, presentations, journal papers, and even your thesis!</p>
<p>The presentation was designed to provide a whistle-stop tour of the benefits of RMarkdown, explaining the basic syntax to get started and highlighting some of the more advance things which you could use RMarkdown for.</p>

<p>The presentation introduced the package <em>sotonthesis</em>, which is a template designed to create documents within RMarkdown in line with the University of Southampton Thesis template.</p>
